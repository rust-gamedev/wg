# Rust game development working group

The game development working group's main purpose is to make Rust a first-class option for game developers.

## What are we doing?

At the very high level we have two main tasks:

* To improve the experience of people using rust for game development. 
We want game developers to have a representation in the Rust project.
We are a bridge between them and the Rust dev team.

* Share knowledge and make game engine development more accessible for people that are not engine developers. We know it can be an intimidating and scary field when you're just starting out.

## Goals

* Gather a list of all the main gaps that separate us from the ideal state described in the introduction. Could be tooling gaps, a language feature gap, a library feature (eg. custom allocators). After this is gathered, we can start working on the biggest issues in that list. There are a few initial candidates but we encourage you to tell us where you are having issues so we can help. It may involve helping out with a low-level library.

* Write guides to make game development in Rust more accessible for everyone.

## What we are not doing

* We will not build games or a game engine as this working group. However, we can create low-level tooling or libraries that are aimed at the healthy growth of the ecosystem and is not meant to be opinionated or favor an engine over another.
* We will not be curators for "approved" game development libraries. Our purpose is to help such engines to exist, not to promote one library over another.
