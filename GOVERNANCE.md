# Governance

This document describes the governance structure for the [Rust Game Development Working Group][org].

## Code of conduct

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) and expect you to do the same!

## Membership

Membership into the `rust-gamedev` organization is given to anyone who is involved in Rust and Game Development or otherwise contributing to the [rust-gamedev][org] repositories.

You can request membership or nominate someone for membership by contacting anyone in the team. We welcome you with open arms!

## How decisions are made

Decisions are made by the working group members after consultations held in public github issues.  
Meetings, chat rooms and forums are not places where decisions are taken.  

It is the duty of the members of this working group to take any decision in the spirit of the charter.

As this working group will grow it is expected that certain teams will be responsible for decisions on the repositories that they own and the core team will step in just in case an agreement can't be achieved.

## Adding repositories

You can propose adding a repository by opening an issue [here][issues]. Please keep proposals aligned with the working group's [charter][charter].
